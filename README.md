- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icons for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Professional typography (loaded via CSS)

### CDN Resources
All external dependencies are loaded via CDN for optimal performance:
```html
<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Font Awesome -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css">

<!-- Bootstrap JS -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download/Clone**: Place all files in a web server directory
2. **Update Content**: Modify HTML files with personal information
3. **Add Images**: Place photos in `assets/img/` directory
4. **Customize Styling**: Modify `css/style.css` for design changes
5. **Configure Forms**: Set up actual form submission (currently simulated)

## Form Submission

The contact form currently uses JavaScript simulation. To enable real form submission:

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to a server-side script (PHP, Node.js, etc.)
2. **Email Service**: Integrate with services like EmailJS, Formspree, or Netlify Forms
3. **Database Storage**: Store submissions in a database for tracking

Example EmailJS integration:
```javascript
// Replace the setTimeout simulation in main.js with:
emailjs.sendForm('service_id', 'template_id', this)
    .then(() => {
        // Success handling
    }, (error) => {
        // Error handling
    });
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Optimization**: Compress images before uploading
- **CDN Usage**: External libraries loaded from fast CDNs
- **Minification**: Consider minifying CSS/JS for production
- **Caching**: Implement browser caching for static assets

## SEO Considerations

- **Meta Tags**: Add appropriate meta descriptions and keywords
- **Structured Data**: Consider adding JSON-LD for academic profile
- **Open Graph**: Add OG tags for social media sharing
- **Sitemap**: Create XML sitemap for search engines

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Keep Bootstrap and Font Awesome versions current
- Update publication lists and research information
- Refresh course listings each semester
- Update contact information as needed

### Security
- Validate all form inputs server-side
- Implement CSRF protection for forms
- Use HTTPS for any data transmission
- Regular security audits for dependencies
